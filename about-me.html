Hi! I'm a passionate and curious developer who loves building things with code. I specialize in web development, and I also have strong skills in Python, C, and C++. Whether it's creating responsive websites or writing efficient backend code, I enjoy solving problems and learning something new every day.

With a growing interest in technology and a hands-on approach to learning, I'm always looking for opportunities to improve, collaborate, and create meaningful digital experiences.
